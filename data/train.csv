"I'm excited to share that I've wrapped up my Academic Internship in Big Data Analytics and Deep Learning at the National University of Singapore (NUS), organized by Corporate Gurukul. This was honestly a big learning curve and a proper deep dive into AI and machine learning.
For my project, I worked on building an AI-powered system for historic artwork classification and forgery detection. The goal was to make art cataloging and fraud detection faster, smarter, and more accurate using deep learning (ResNet50, GANs) and computer vision. From merging messy metadata to training on huge datasets, every step had its own challenges and lessons.
Big thanks to Radhika Datar and Rajesh Panda for their guidance, and to my amazing team. I wouldn't have survived the 45,000+ images, code merge chaos, and late-night debugging sessions without everyone's help.
This project taught me a lot about handling real-world data, training deep learning models, and actually deploying AI for practical use cases like spotting art forgeries and classifying artworks. It also made me appreciate how important teamwork is for these kinds of projects.
Looking forward to what's next!

"Two months, countless lines of TCL and Python, and one unforgettable journey at Cadence every day brought something new to learn, build, and debug!
As a DFT Intern at Cadence Design Systems, I had the chance to explore the concepts of Testing architecture, Wrappers, etc. Some of the things I worked on:
 ~ Automated IEEE 1500 wrapper insertion using TCL, integrating UPF(Unified Power Format) for multi-power domain SoC flows
 ~ Built a self-contained DFT lab to enable wrapper insertion, scan testing, and test vector debugging using Genus and Xcelium for waveform analysis
 ~ Created WrapSim, a Python-based simulator to insert scan chains and simulate Intest and Extest of custom RTL designs
 ~ Initiated a research project using LLMs to optimize scan chain wirelength under Power, Timing, and DFT constraints
I'm deeply grateful to my mentors Pravesh Rathee, Sameer Chillarige, and Jyotirmoy Saikia. I would also like to thank srujana padala and Somdutt Javre for their constant support and insightful feedback
This internship not only strengthened my technical foundation, but also gave me a glimpse into the real-world complexity of silicon design and test.
